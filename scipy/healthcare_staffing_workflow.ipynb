    "A hospital wants a simple staffing decision helper for a single department per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Healthcare staffing decisions balance patient safety (adequate care), regulatory compliance (minimum staffing), and budget constraints (maximum staffing). Automating this workflow ensures consistent, auditable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs (per day):**\n",
    "- `forecast_patients` (float) — Expected patient count (from predictive models or historical data)\n",
    "- `patients_per_nurse` (float) — Nominal capacity per nurse (workload standard, e.g., 10 patients/nurse)\n",
    "- `min_nurses` (int) — Must always have at least this many (safety/regulatory minimum)\n",
    "- `max_nurses` (int) — Upper bound due to budget constraints\n",
    "- `critical_threshold` (float) — If forecast patients exceed this, add emergency nurses (safety trigger)\n",
    "- `emergency_nurses` (int) — Additional nurses to add when above threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "**The logic (step-by-step workflow):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base calculation:** Compute `base_required = ceil(forecast_patients / patients_per_nurse)`.\n",
    "   - Uses ceiling to always round UP (understaffing is dangerous)\n",
    "   - Example: 81 patients ÷ 10 per nurse = 8.1 → 9 nurses\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply constraints:** Enforce minimum and maximum bounds:\n",
    "   `clamped_required = min(max(base_required, min_nurses), max_nurses)`.\n",
    "   - Inner `max()` ensures we meet minimum requirement\n",
    "   - Outer `min()` ensures we don't exceed budget\n",
    "   - This \"clamping\" pattern is common in constraint-based systems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emergency rule:** If `forecast_patients > critical_threshold`, then:\n",
    "   `final_nurses = min(clamped_required + emergency_nurses, max_nurses)`\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "   `final_nurses = clamped_required`.\n",
    "   - Conditional logic implements business rule\n",
    "   - Still respects max_nurses limit (budget constraint)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transparency:** Provide both intermediate and final values for monitoring and UI.\n",
    "   - Enables audit trails\n",
    "   - Helps users understand the decision\n",
    "   - Supports debugging and optimization\n",
    "\n",
